# DeepTrafficJS
Huge shoutout to MIT and Lex Fridman for offering the [self-driving car course](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) to the public. After watching the first two MIT 6.S094 lectures ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L0TKZQcUtA&feature=youtu.be) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDzM8r3WgBw&feature=youtu.be)), it was time to attempt [deeptrafficjs](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptrafficjs/).

Also, another shoutout to [Anton Penchenko](https://github.com/parilo/DeepTraffic-solution) for posting his code on Github. My code closely resembles his final solution, so you can call this essentially a replication of his results.

The main goal for me going through this project was to learn the basics of training neural networks, and I would say this was definitely achieved (even through replication of results). 

My final code was able to hit 74.29mph, which isn't too far off the current top score of 76.29mph. There are definitely some improvements that can be made in my code:
- Increase the number of 'trainIterations' 
- Play around with the number of hidden layers and number of neurons.

Other students had a variety of total hidden layers and number of neurons that yielded similar results to mine. It would be fun to continue optimizing until I hit ~76mph.
